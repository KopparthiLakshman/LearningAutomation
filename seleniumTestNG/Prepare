framework is a hybrid model 
It is maven project and pom.xml is the root where we will have configured all the required dependencies.

where in we have used, selenium, java, cucumber , testng, AUTreporting, extent reporting

we have mainly two package - src/main/java and src/test/java package
Folder - as reports, screenshots, properties, Logs....
we will store the apropriate details in the folders

In test package - we will maintain all out testscripts 
In main package we a have all our java code that supports the testscripts
	in main package again we have sub packages - for base - common action, loading properties ... , pages action, pages, listeners, 

we have a package where we will have feature files
